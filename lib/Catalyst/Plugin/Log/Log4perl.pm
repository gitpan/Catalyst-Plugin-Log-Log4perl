=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Plugin::Log::Log4perl - Catalyst plugin to initialize Log::Log4perl from the application's configuration

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # in MyApp.pm

  use Catalyst qw/ ConfigLoader Log::Log4perl /;
  use Catalyst::Log::Log4perl;

  ...

  __PACKAGE__->log( Catalyst::Log::Log4perl->new );

  __PACKAGE__->setup();


  # in myapp.yaml

  name: MyApp
  Plugin::Log::Log4perl:
    conf: '__HOME__/log4perl.conf'
    watch_delay: 60 # optional

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to initialize L<Log::Log4perl|Log::Log4perl>
within the application's configuration.  This is especially useful
when using L<Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigLoader|Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigLoader>
to load configuration files.  It is meant to be used in conjunction
with L<Catalyst::Log::Log4perl|Catalyst::Log::Log4perl>, but can
also be used stand-alone.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=over 2

=item B<conf>

This will be passed directly to C<Log::Log4perl-E<gt>init()>, so it can
be anything that that method can support.  This includes the name
of a configuration file or a C<HASH> reference.  See the
L<Log::Log4perl|Log::Log4perl> documentation for more information.

=item B<watch_delay>

If this is present, C<Log::Log4perl-E<gt>init_and_watch()> is used
for L<Log::Log4perl|Log::Log4perl> initialization with the given delay.

=back

=head1 BUGS

If L<Catalyst::Log::Log4perl|Catalyst::Log::Log4perl> is used,
this module will re-initialize L<Log::Log4perl|Log::Log4perl>
which is not recommended.  This is unavoidable, though, since your
application's logger is configured prior to running C<MyApp-E<gt>setup()>.
